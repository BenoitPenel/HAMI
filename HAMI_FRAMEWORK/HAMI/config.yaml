#This file is a configuration file associated with the snakemake of the HAMI framework (HAMI_PIPELINE.smk).
#
#A Snakemake configuration file (config.yaml) is a file written in Python that contains configuration settings for a Snakemake workflow.
#The configuration file allows users to customize various aspects of the workflow, such as file paths and other workflow-specific settings.
#
#Please adapt the configuration file according to our projet by following the example given for the test dataset

#Information about samples name : 
#Your samples need to be discrimated on the basis of their name. Use alphabectic prefix and number for it e.g : CMEY0001 
#Duplicate of samples is also necessary. Discrimination between duplicate will be done using suffix : e.g : CMEY0001A / CMEY0001B

Samplesprefix:
  Metabarcoding : "CMEY0"
  Barcoding : "xxxNAxxx" #Put "xxxNAxxx" if no barcoding data

#Information about the taxonomic groups and the DNA targeted :
#Please check the reading frame of our target DNA before running.
#With test data, reading frame value is set at 1, according to the target DNA using BF3 + BR2 primer pair
#(CCHGAYATRGCHTTYCCHCG / TCDGGRTGNCCRAARAAYCA) from Elbrecht et al., 2019 and Elbrecht & Leese, 2017 

Target_group : "Coleoptera" # can either be: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family or Genus
ADN_length : 418 
Reading_frame: 1 #value should be integer [0,2]. 
codon_stop : ["TAA","TAG"] # List as many stop codons as necessary depending on the DNA fragment and the targeted phylum
Threshold : 97 #Usually set at 97%, but can be set higher (max 100) or lower.
